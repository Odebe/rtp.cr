# rtp.cr

WIP: simple parser for RTP packets. Later will be more.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     rtp:
       github: Odebe/rtp
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "rtp"

# look at examples/
```

To build examples simply run.
```sh
make build_examples
```
Look for binaries in bin, lol.
